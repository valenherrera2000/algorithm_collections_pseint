# Algorithm Collections (PseInt)

This repository contains a collection of algorithm exercises implemented in PseInt, completed as part of my algorithms class.

## Note
 The codes within this repository are originally written in Spanish. For sharing purposes, *translations will appear commented above each line*
 
## Algorithms

The algorithms included in this collection cover:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Data structure implementations (e.g., Array, Linked List)
.

## Usage

Each algorithm is contained within its own PseInt file (.pseint). To use them, simply open the respective file in PseInt and execute/run the algorithm.
